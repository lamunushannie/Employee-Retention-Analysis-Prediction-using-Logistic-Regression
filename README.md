# Employee Retention Analysis & Prediction

This project analyzes employee data to understand factors affecting retention and builds a logistic regression model to predict whether an employee will leave.

## Steps
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key variables.
2. Visualizations:
   - Salary vs Retention
   - Department vs Retention
3. Built logistic regression model using selected features.
4. Evaluated model using accuracy score.

## Tools
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
- Google colab

## Results
- Higher salaries and certain departments have higher retention.
- Logistic Regression model accuracy: 0.762% 

## Conclusion
The project helps understand retention patterns and predict employee turnover for better HR strategies.
